# 8. Python Triangle Quest 2

You are given a positive integer . 
Your task is to print a palindromic triangle of size .

For example, a palindromic triangle of size  is:

    1
    121
    12321
    1234321
    123454321

You can't take more than two lines. The first line (a for-statement) is already written for you. 
You have to complete the code using exactly one print statement.

Note: 
Using anything related to strings will give a score of . 
Using more than one for-statement will give a score of .

Input Format

A single line of input containing the integer .

Constraints

* 

Output Format

Print the palindromic triangle of size  as explained above.

Sample Input

```
5

```

Sample Output

```
1
121
12321
1234321
123454321
```

### list 直接输出来是矩阵，所以这里加一个 * 号，代表输出里面的数字

```python
for i in range(0,int(input())): 
    #print ([1, 121, 12321, 1234321, 123454321, 12345654321, 1234567654321, 123456787654321, 12345678987654321, 12345678910987654321][i])
    print(*(list(range(1, i)) + list(range(i, 0, -1))), sep="")
```
