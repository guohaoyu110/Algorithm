# 23. Python Collections Word Order

Using [`list`](file:///Users/haoyuguo/Library/Application%20Support/Dash/Versioned%20DocSets/Python%203%20-%20DHDocsetDownloader/3-7-2/Python%203.docset/Contents/Resources/Documents/doc/library/stdtypes.html#list "list") as the [`default\_factory`](file:///Users/haoyuguo/Library/Application%20Support/Dash/Versioned%20DocSets/Python%203%20-%20DHDocsetDownloader/3-7-2/Python%203.docset/Contents/Resources/Documents/doc/library/collections.html#collections.defaultdict.default_factory "collections.defaultdict.default_factory"), it is easy to group a sequence of key-value pairs into a dictionary of lists:

    \>\>\> s = [('yellow', 1), ('blue', 2), ('yellow', 3), ('blue', 4), ('red', 1)]
    \>\>\> d = defaultdict(list)
    \>\>\> for k, v in s:
    ...     d[k].append(v)
    ...
    \>\>\> sorted(d.items())
    [('blue', [2, 4]), ('red', [1]), ('yellow', [1, 3])]

You are given  words. Some words may repeat. For each word, output its number of occurrences. The output order should correspond with the input order of appearance of the word. See the sample input/output for clarification.

**Note:** Each input line ends with a **"\\n"** character.

**Constraints:** 

The sum of the lengths of all the words do not exceed  
All the words are composed of lowercase English letters only.

**Input Format**

The first line contains the integer, . 
The next  lines each contain a word.

**Output Format**

Output  lines. 
On the first line, output the number of distinct words from the input. 
On the second line, output the number of occurrences for each distinct word according to their appearance in the input.

**Sample Input**

```
4
bcdef
abcdefg
bcde
bcdef

```

**Sample Output**

```
3
2 1 1

```

**Explanation**

There are  distinct words. Here, **"bcdef"** appears twice in the input at the first and last positions. The other words appear once each. The order of the first appearances are **"bcdef"**, **"abcdefg"** and **"bcde"** which corresponds to the output.

***解释：一共有3个不同的字符串；然后分别每个字符串出现的次数为2，1，1***

```python
# Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT
from collections import defaultdict
if __name__ == '__main__':
    n = int(input())
    #for i in range(n):
    if 1<=n<=10**5: 
        d=defaultdict(int)
        for i in range(n):
            key=input()
            d[key] +=1
        print(len(d.keys())) 
# the common usage 1)keys 2)values  3)items
        x=(d.values())
        print(*x)
```

### Recall:

```
>>> from collections import Counter
>>> 
>>> myList = [1,1,2,3,4,5,3,2,3,4,2,1,2,3]
>>> print Counter(myList)
Counter({2: 4, 3: 4, 1: 3, 4: 2, 5: 1})
>>>

### `>>> print Counter(myList).items()`

[(1, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 2), (5, 1)]
>>> 

### `>>> print Counter(myList).keys()`

[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
>>> 

### `>>> print Counter(myList).values()`

[3, 4, 4, 2, 1]
