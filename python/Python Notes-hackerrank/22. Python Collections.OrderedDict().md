# 22. Python Collections.OrderedDict()

### [collections.OrderedDict](https://docs.python.org/2/library/collections.html#ordereddict-objects)

An OrderedDict is a dictionary that remembers the order of the keys that were inserted first. If a new entry overwrites an existing entry, the original insertion position is left unchanged.

### Python中的字典对象可以以“键：值”的方式存取数据。OrderedDict是它的一个子类，实现了对字典对象中元素的排序。比如下面比较了两种方式的不同：

Example

Code

```
>>> from collections import OrderedDict
>>> 
>>> ordinary_dictionary = {}
>>> ordinary_dictionary['a'] = 1
>>> ordinary_dictionary['b'] = 2
>>> ordinary_dictionary['c'] = 3
>>> ordinary_dictionary['d'] = 4
>>> ordinary_dictionary['e'] = 5
>>> 
>>> print ordinary_dictionary
{'a': 1, 'c': 3, 'b': 2, 'e': 5, 'd': 4}
>>> 
>>> ordered_dictionary = OrderedDict()
>>> ordered_dictionary['a'] = 1
>>> ordered_dictionary['b'] = 2
>>> ordered_dictionary['c'] = 3
>>> ordered_dictionary['d'] = 4
>>> ordered_dictionary['e'] = 5
>>> 
>>> print ordered_dictionary
OrderedDict([('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3), ('d', 4), ('e', 5)])

```

Task

You are the manager of a supermarket. 
You have a list of  items together with their prices that consumers bought on a particular day. 
Your task is to print each `item_name` and `net_price` in order of its first occurrence.

`item_name` = Name of the item. 
`net_price` = Quantity of the item sold multiplied by the price of each item.

Input Format

The first line contains the number of items, . 
The next  lines contains the item's name and price, separated by a space.

Constraints

Output Format

Print the `item_name` and `net_price` in order of its first occurrence.

Sample Input

```
9
BANANA FRIES 12
POTATO CHIPS 30
APPLE JUICE 10
CANDY 5
APPLE JUICE 10
CANDY 5
CANDY 5
CANDY 5
POTATO CHIPS 30

```

Sample Output

```
BANANA FRIES 12
POTATO CHIPS 60
APPLE JUICE 20
CANDY 20

```

Explanation

BANANA FRIES: Quantity bought: , Price:  
`Net Price`:  
POTATO CHIPS: Quantity bought: , Price: 
`Net Price`:  
APPLE JUICE: Quantity bought: , Price:  
`Net Price`:  
CANDY: Quantity bought: , Price:  
`Net Price`: 20

```python
# Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT
from collections import OrderedDict

number_ = int(input())
odict = OrderedDict()
for i in range(number_):
    litem = input().split(' ')
    price = int(litem[-1])
    # when mentions the last element, use "-1"
    item_name = " ".join(litem[:-1])
    # before the last element, use " " to join the elements
    if odict.get(item_name):
        odict[item_name] += price
    else:
        odict[item_name] = price

for i,v in odict.items():
    print(i,v)
