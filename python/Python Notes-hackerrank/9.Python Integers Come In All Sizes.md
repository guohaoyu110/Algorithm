# 9.Python Integers Come In All Sizes

Integers in Python can be as big as the bytes in your machine's memory. There is no limit in size as there is:  (c++ int) or  (C++ long long int).

As we know, the result of  grows really fast with increasing .

Let's do some calculations on very large integers.

Task 
Read four numbers, , , , and , and print the result of .

Input Format 
Integers , , , and  are given on four separate lines, respectively.

Constraints 

Output Format 
Print the result of  on one line.

Sample Input

```
9
29
7
27

```

Sample Output

```
4710194409608608369201743232  

```

Note: This result is bigger than . Hence, it won't fit in the long long int of C++ or a 64-bit integer.

## Python中用pow()函数，不受数位的限制，可以研究下相关的源码

```python
# Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT
if __name__== '__main__':
    a=int(input())
    b=int(input())
    c=int(input())
    d=int(input())
    e=pow(a,b)+pow(c,d)
    print(e)
```
